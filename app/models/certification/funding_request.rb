module Certification
  # A hardware project owner's request for a build grant, submitted from the
  # design stage. Routes through the same reviewer queue as
  # ship certifications (Certification::Reviewable). On approval the project
  # switches to the build stage and an HCB card grant is issued for the approved
  # amount, capped by the tier's max.
  #
  # When the project's mission hands out a design kit (an after_design prize),
  # approval delivers that kit for redemption instead of a cash grant: no HCB
  # grant is issued and the tier/amount fields are vestigial (defaulted, hidden
  # in the request form).
  #
  # A reviewer can also approve without any funding at all (the builder already
  # has the parts, or is covered some other way). That is an ordinary approval
  # recorded as an approved amount of $0, which issues no grant. On a kit
  # mission the same verdict waives the kit (`prizes_waived`): the project still
  # moves to the build stage, but nothing is owed and nothing is claimable.
