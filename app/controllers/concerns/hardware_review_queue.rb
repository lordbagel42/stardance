# The two-stage hardware review dash (design funding + build certification),
# shared between the global reviewer queue (Admin::Certification::HardwareReviews)
# and a mission's own queue (Admin::Missions::HardwareReviews). The host controller
# supplies which projects it covers, how to authorize, and the route helpers; the
# queue building, stats, leaderboards and review context live here.

# Host controllers must implement:
#   reviewable_projects            -> a Project relation (the hardware projects this dash reviews)
#   authorize_hardware_queue       -> per-action auth for the list/next actions
#   authorize_hardware_review(project)
#   hardware_review_path(project)
#   hardware_queue_path(stage)     -> "design" | "build"
#   hardware_next_path(stage:, skip: nil)
